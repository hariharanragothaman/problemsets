Similarities:

    Both support 'in' operator for memebership checking

Differences:
    Tuple is IMMUTABLE

Learnings:
    Tuples are used to hold heterogeneous groups of values.
    Lists are used for homogeneous group of values.
    Tuples are faster to build; and have a lesser memory footprint

    What are the actual benifits of immutability?
    1. Immutable objects are container friendly and thread-safe
    2. Example scenario: If an immutable object is inserted in a set
                         Changed
                         and then the changed object is looked up
                         --- the look up will fail!!

                    Since the hashcode has changed from when it was added into the set.
                    For this reason; tuples can be put into sets as map-keys, whereas lists cannot
